Project 4 (worth 16 bonus points for your project grade)

Read pages 257-262 in the textbook. That area contains pseudocode for the branch and bound algorithm for the 0-1 Knapsack problem. 

Phase 1. Implement it.
Phase 2. Turn in the same thing as you did for project 3, but turn it in on Canvas. You might note that this is recursively the same work as in project 2, which is in turn the same work as in project 1, which is the base case. You are welcome.
