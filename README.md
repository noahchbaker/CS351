# CS351 - Algorithms

Language: C++\
Professor: Dr. Ankur Gupta

## Description

This course provides a systematic study of data structures and algorithms with an introduction to theoretical computer science. Topics covered include greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, backtracking, branch and bound, searching and sorting algorithms, mathematical algorithms, time and space complexity, and an introduction to the theory of NP-completeness.

## Projects

1. Project 1 - Implementation of a greedy algorithm to solve the 0-1 Knapsack problem.
2. Project 2 - Implementation of a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the 0-1 Knapsack problem.
3. Project 3 - Implementation of a backtracking algorithm to solve the 0-1 Knapsack problem.
4. Project 4 - Implementation of a branch and bound algorithm to solve the 0-1 Knapsack problem.
